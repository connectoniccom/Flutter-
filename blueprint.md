# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture, features, and design of a Flutter application integrated with Firebase. The goal is to create a multi-platform application that shares a backend with an existing Next.js web application.

## Implemented Features

### Version 1.0

*   **Project Setup:**
    *   Initialized a new Flutter project.
    *   Configured the project for both Android and Web platforms.
*   **Firebase Integration:**
    *   Connected the Flutter application to the `connectonic-live` Firebase project.
    *   Added `firebase_core` dependency.
    *   Initialized Firebase in `lib/main.dart`.
    *   Generated `firebase_options.dart` for both Android and Web.
*   **Version Control:**
    *   Set up a Git repository and pushed the initial project to GitHub.

## Current Plan

*   Create a `blueprint.md` file to document the project.
*   Commit and push all the recent changes to the repository.
